// ANGULAR II
<h5>Scopes</h5>
<p>Scope access through DOM nodes: <span>angular.element(document).find('orc-content').scope()</span><br>
    Production code best practice $compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled is set to false, calling .scope() on a DOM node will
    return undefined.
    You can still access the scope through the console: <span>angular.reloadWithDebugInfo()</span>
</p>
<p>Many directives create child scopes such as ngRepeat, ngIf, and ngController. When resolving a model, the lookup
    starts on the current scope and goes through every parent scope, all the way to $rootScope.
    If the model is a primitive, the child scope will just create a new model. But if the change is to a property of a
    model object, the lookup on parent scopes will find the referenced object and change its actual property. A new
    model would not be set on the current scope, so no masking would occur.
</p>
<p>Whenever you need a directive that you know will be used in a single place, or which you don’t expect to conflict
    with whatever environment it is used in, there is no need to use isolated scope.Core angular directives don’t use isolated scope at all.<br>
    There are two main reasons: you can’t apply two isolated scope directives to an element, and you may encounter
    issues with nesting / inheritance / event processing. Especially regarding transclusion - the effects may not be
    what you expect.</p>

<p>Using the scope option in directive you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>create a child scope prototypically inherited with scope: true</li>
    <li>create an isolated scope with scope: {} then you can bind some property to parent scopes with '@', '&', '='.</li>
    <li>decide to not create a new scope and use parent with scope: false (default).</li>
</ul>

<h5>Garbage</h5>
<p>The following need to be manually cleaned up:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Any watchers that are not bound to the current scope (e.g. bound to $rootScope)</li>
    <li>Intervals</li>
    <li>Timeouts</li>
    <li>Variables referencing DOM in directives</li>
    <li>Dodgy jQuery plugins, e.g. those that don’t have handlers reacting to the JavaScript $destroy event</li>
</ol>
<p>An object is essentially a hashtable of name-value pairs where the names (i.e., keys) are strings. And they are always strings. In fact, when an object other than a string is used as a key in JavaScript, no error occurs; rather, JavaScript silently converts it to a string and uses that value as the key instead.</p>
